# Dog Picker - an example Micro frontend app monorepo

This monorepo consists of 3 small micro frontend apps and the root app that stitches them together:

- The navbar - written with Svelte
- The home/history view - written with Vue
- The rating view - written with Vue

[single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) was used to glue it all together.
